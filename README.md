## Installation

## Note

I've added 1 package that wasn't included in the initial setup, `@tabler/icons-react`, to be able to add icons

I also made a really small change to `servers.ts`, I added an export to access the TS in the application:

```
export type { ExchangeRate, Planet, User, Transaction };
```
